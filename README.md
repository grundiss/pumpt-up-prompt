<h1 align="center">Pumped Up Prompt</h1>

Pumped Up Prompt is a set of solutions to improve your shell experience. It contains:
1. Custom segmented shell prompt;
2. Font with segment separators and icons*;
3. Optional improvements.

*Pumped Up Prompt uses the same Unicode places as Powerline Patched fonts (e.g. [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)), so you can use Pumped Up Prompt fonts instead of them if you don't need other functionality.

## Features
Light ðŸŽˆ<br/>
	Pure bash. No hidden engines in the background. Fast even in huge projects.<br/>
    
Beautiful ðŸŽ€<br/>
	All separators are handcrafted and pixel-perfect. Enjoy the smoothness.<br/>
    
Hard to pronounce ðŸ¤”<br/>
	Not really a feature, but... you can use it as a tongue twister!

## Terminals
Notes on using Pumpt up Prompt with different terminal emulators:

### iTerm
Pumpt up Prompt was originally developed for iTerm2, there should be no problems.

### Hyper
Hyper treats characters as a browser (which differs from how iTerm does it), so separators won't align perfectly. Fortunately, you can easily fix it by adding some CSS to Hyper settings (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>).<br/>
Start with this configuration:

    // custom css to embed in the terminal window
    termCSS: '.unicode-node { margin-left: -1px; padding-right: 1px; overflow: hidden; }',

Then add `line-height` (1.2em by default) and `font-size` (1em by default) changes if needed.

### Terminal.app
Terminal.app has a mechanism that changes color for the last prompt character ([Some research on the topic](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3163)). There is no way to disable this behavior. I suggest you try other emulators if that bothers you.

## TODO
- [ ] Update font files for the iTerm2 v3
- [ ] Add more previews
- [ ] Create a complete release
- [ ] Add terminal theme recommendations
- [ ] Remove line wrap bug caused by unclosed color tags
- [ ] Research the possibility of using 256 colors
- [ ] Windows OS adaptation
- [ ] Fix git autocomplete when using git aliases
